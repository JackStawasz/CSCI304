## Effort Distribution

- Jack: 100%

## Total Completion Time

Roughly ~8 hours

## Concerns

- I was unsure if the grader could track my results so I wrote each output into a "Result" array in memory. I would appreciate this to be included in the instructions.

## Code Execution Instructions

- Add inputs by editing the Input array at the bottom of the code.

- Results are saved into array starting at byte position 0x284.

- Part 1 inputs must come before the 0xFFFFFFFF flag which signals the end of the array.

- Part 2 inputs must be added in pairs (first element to the power of the second element).
